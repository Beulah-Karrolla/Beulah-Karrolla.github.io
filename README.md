# Beulah Karrolla (Introduction)
I am a dedicated engineering professional with expertise in neural networks, machine learning, and handling large data. Currently, I am a research intern at the Texas Advanced Computing Center, focusing on Science Gateways. I hold a master's degree in computer science from The Ohio State University, where I specialized in speech processing. My master's project included advanced speech processing techniques such as zero-shot speech classification and customized wake word detection, with a working demo available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xBSs1LuXsFoGTNqXDjBAUH8bx109A0Zk/view?usp=sharing). Additionally, I have experience as a Graduate Teaching Associate and have worked at Oracle as an Application Developer. Looking forward to an opportunity to pursue Machine learning research in tech, by joining the brilliant community of researchers.
